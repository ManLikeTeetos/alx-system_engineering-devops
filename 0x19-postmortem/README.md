## Postmortem: Nginx Server Outage Due to Space Constraint from MySQL Error Logs
# Issue Summary:

# Duration: May 10, 2023, 3:00 PM to May 11, 2023, 9:00 AM (UTC)
# Impact: The Nginx server was down during the outage, resulting in a complete service disruption. Users experienced HTTP 503 errors when attempting to access the website. Approximately 80% of users were affected during this period.
# Timeline:

# Issue Detection: May 10, 2023, 3:30 PM (UTC)
The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden increase in HTTP 503 error responses. <br/>
Actions Taken:
Engineers initially investigated the Nginx server configuration and restarted the service, assuming it was a temporary glitch.
Due to continued errors, attention was shifted to the backend systems, specifically the MySQL database, as it was suspected to be the root cause.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
The initial focus on the Nginx server configuration led to limited progress in identifying the true cause of the issue. This delay in understanding the underlying problem prolonged the outage.
Escalation:
The incident was escalated to the database administration team as the investigation pointed towards MySQL as the potential cause of the problem.
Incident Resolution:
Upon careful analysis, it was discovered that the error logs generated by MySQL had consumed a significant amount of disk space on the server hosting the Nginx service.
The excess log files caused the server's disk to reach its maximum capacity, resulting in the Nginx service being unable to write essential files and leading to the service outage.
To resolve the issue, the database administration team implemented a log rotation mechanism to prevent unlimited log growth, ensuring the disk space would not be exhausted in the future.
Additionally, a cleanup process was performed to remove unnecessary error logs and reclaim disk space.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was the excessive growth of MySQL error logs, which consumed the available disk space on the server hosting Nginx.
Resolution:
The issue was fixed by implementing a log rotation mechanism for the MySQL error logs, ensuring that they would be properly managed and limited in size. This prevented the disk space from being exhausted and allowed the Nginx server to function normally.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvement/Fixes:
Implement regular log monitoring to detect abnormal growth patterns and disk space usage.
Automate log rotation and cleanup processes to prevent log files from overwhelming the server.
Establish disk space monitoring to proactively identify and address potential space constraints.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Patch the MySQL server to ensure proper log rotation functionality.
Set up a scheduled job to remove unnecessary log files regularly.
Implement disk space monitoring and alerting mechanisms to prevent similar incidents in the future.
