# Postmortem: Nginx Server Outage - When MySQL Error Logs Became Space Invaders!

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: May 10, 2023, 3:00 PM to May 11, 2023, 9:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact**: The Nginx server took an unexpected vacation during the outage, leaving users stranded with HTTP 503 errors. Approximately 80% of users found themselves in a digital desert, thirsty for access to the website.

## Timeline
- **Issue Detection**: May 10, 2023, 3:30 PM (UTC)
  - Our trusty monitoring alerts went haywire, screaming about a sudden surge in HTTP 503 errors. They were like our digital canaries in the coal mine, except they can't sing.
  
- **Actions Taken**:
  - We dove headfirst into the Nginx server configuration, hoping to tickle some hidden settings into cooperating. A quick restart was attempted, because sometimes even servers need a nap.
  - Alas, the errors persisted, and the finger of suspicion pointed towards the MySQL database. We shifted gears and ventured into its depths, armed with a can-do attitude and a strong dose of caffeine.
  
- **Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths**:
  - Our initial focus on the Nginx server configuration felt like wandering in a dark room searching for the light switch. Spoiler alert: it was not there. Rookie mistake!
  
- **Escalation**:
  - The incident had us waving the white flag, calling upon the mystical powers of the database administration team. They were our knights in shining code, ready to battle the lurking MySQL dragons.
  
- **Incident Resolution**:
  - Lo and behold, the culprits were discovered! The MySQL error logs had grown exponentially, hogging the server's disk space like greedy data pirates. We didn't see that coming!
  - To restore harmony in the digital realm, we implemented a log rotation mechanism, putting those logs on a tight leash. The server could finally breathe, free from the tyranny of space invaders.
  - As part of our disk space detox, we performed a thorough cleanup, bidding farewell to unnecessary log files. It was like Marie Kondo visited our server, sparking joy with every deleted byte.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause**:
  - The dastardly root cause of the outage was the bloated MySQL error logs, growing like a runaway tumbleweed and devouring precious disk space. Who knew logs could be so demanding?
- **Resolution**:
  - We tamed those unruly logs by implementing a log rotation mechanism, teaching them the art of moderation. With their size under control, disk space could finally breathe easy, and the Nginx server regained its strength.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvement/Fixes**:
  - Embrace the art of log monitoring to detect log growth gone wild and disk space crisis in the making. Our logs need to learn the concept of personal space.
  - Automate log rotation and cleanup processes to keep those logs in line and prevent them from becoming space invaders. No more uninvited log parties!
  - Establish vigilant disk space monitoring to catch any sneaky attempts at space conquest before they spiral out of control. Keep an eye on the disk, it's a sneaky one!
  
- **Tasks to Address the Issue**:
  - Patch the MySQL server with a log rotation magic spell to ensure logs don't turn into disk-devouring monsters.
  - Set up a scheduled cleaning crew to sweep away unnecessary log files regularly. Let's declutter that server!
  - Implement disk space
